# DEPENDENCY-PARSER-FOR-TELUGU

**Completed this project as part of my MSc Data Science final year project.**  

### **Key Highlights:**  
- Developed a **Dependency Parser for Telugu Language**, focusing on **grammatical structure analysis** and **syntactic dependency identification**.  
- Studied and explored the **challenges of Telugu NLP**, such as **free word order** and **rich morphology**.  
- Implemented **dependency parsing models** using **Stanza, MaltParser, and spaCy**, integrating **Google Translate API** for **Telugu-to-English translation**.  
- Designed an **interactive UI** using **Gradio** for user-friendly sentence analysis, including **text and speech input** processing.  
- Experimented with different **Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques**, including **Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging, dependency tree visualization, and speech-to-text integration**.  
- Evaluated the modelâ€™s **accuracy and efficiency** in parsing Telugu sentences, identifying linguistic structures, and improving Telugu NLP applications.  

This project enhanced my understanding of **Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and AI-driven text analysis**, contributing to advancements in **Telugu language processing**.
